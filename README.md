# parameter_estimation

Parameter estimation is a process used in statistics and machine learning to determine the values of unknown parameters in a model based on observed data. In simpler terms, it's like figuring out the missing pieces of a puzzle by analyzing the pieces you do have. These "missing pieces" are the parameters of a mathematical or statistical model, and the "observed data" are the actual data points you have collected.
